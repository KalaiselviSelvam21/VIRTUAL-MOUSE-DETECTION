# VIRTUAL-MOUSE-DETECTION

**A Virtual Mouse allows users to control the mouse pointer on a computer screen using hand gestures. This project leverages computer vision techniques to detect and interpret hand movements, enabling an innovative, touch-free interaction method.**


# Features:

- Gesture Control: Uses hand gestures for cursor movement, clicking, scrolling, and dragging.
- Multi-Hand Recognition: Detects and classifies gestures from both hands, adapting control accordingly.
- System Integration: Adjusts system brightness and volume using pinch gestures.

# Technologies:

- OpenCV: For video capture and processing.
- Mediapipe: For hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- PyAutoGUI: Automates mouse movements and system interactions.
- PyCaw: Controls system volume.
- Screen Brightness Control: Adjusts screen brightness based on gestures.
